## make_moons.
The "Make Moons" dataset is a synthetic dataset provided by the scikit-learn library, a popular Python module for machine learning. It is designed to generate a sample of two interleaving half circles (moons) that form a two-dimensional dataset. This dataset is particularly useful for demonstrating and visualizing classification algorithms, as it presents a non-linearly separable pattern, which can be challenging for certain algorithms.
For this reason we included the results of this dataset in this folder
